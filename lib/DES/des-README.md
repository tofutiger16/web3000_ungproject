DES
In the desEncryptDecrypt.js file first thng that is done is that if a file is submitted then the contents of it is extracted and put into the variable fileText.  After that the function des starts and all the variables are declared and assigned there respective value from the html page.  Then we use an if statement to see if des is selected on the html page then we look to see if encryption or if decryption is selected.  Finally, we use if and else if statements to see what mode and what padding should be used.  Then to output the text I use innerHTML.
The library that I used was Crypto.js 2.5.3.  The file that I used was crypto-sha1-hmac-pbkdf2-blockmodes-des.js.  In that file I use the tw ofunction at the end named encrypt and decrypt.  Those function use other variable that are declared near the top of the file and that helps you choose the mode and padding.
